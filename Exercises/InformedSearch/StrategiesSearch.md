# Strategies for Uninformed/Informed Search

## alínea a): &emsp;C
#### Justification: It's the next node in the current breadth level being explored (Level 1 - Node B has already been explored)

## alínea b): &emsp;E
#### Justification: It's the first child of B, which is the last explored node (depth exploration)

## alínea c): &emsp;D
#### Justification: It's the node with the lowest edge cost sum, which is 3

## alínea d): &emsp;C
#### Justification: It's the node with the lowest heuristic function value, which is 1

## alínea e): &emsp;G
#### Justification: It's the node where the sum of the path cost and the heuristic value is the lowest, which is 3+5+2 = 10
